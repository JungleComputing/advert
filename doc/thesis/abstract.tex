This document describes our attempts to make use of the \emph{Google App Engine}
\cite{app-engine-www} for scientific purposes, with respect to \emph{Ibis}
\cite{ibis-www}. The Google App Engine provides free resources to run a web
applications on Google's infrastructure. To realize this, Google makes use of a
framework, which runs in a \emph{Python} \cite{python-www} environment, and more
recently, also features a \emph{Java} \cite{java-www} environment. We would like
to use the resources offered by Google for creating an \emph{application storage
server} for Ibis. We provide a detailed design of both client and server, as
well as implementation issues and source code. Also we show two applications of
our application storage server in \emph{JavaGAT} \cite{javagat-www} and\emph{IPL} \cite{ipl-www}. Finally we also present benchmark results, which arediscussed in our evaluation.}
