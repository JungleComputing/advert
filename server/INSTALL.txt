Ibis Advert server source release installation

    Before you try to install the Advert server, an app-engine account is
    needed (including an appspot.com domain and a google account). This can
    be accquired at http://appengine.google.com/.

    The Advert server software requires at least Python runtime environment 
    version 2.5.2. With an older version of Python, some parts will not 
    compile. In addition, the Google webapp Framework, Django's simplejson and
    google.appengine.* packages are required. All are offered by the current
    version of the Google App Engine.
    
Configuration
	Before running/uploading the application, please adjust the configuration
	file "app.yaml" (present in ./server/). The first line (application) should
	contain the application identifier. This is the identifier you selected 
	when you created the application in the Administration Console.
	
	More information about configuring your app can be found at
	http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig.html
    
Upload
    To upload the application to the Google App Eninge, the Google App Engine 
    SDK (for Python) is required. This can be downloaded at 
    http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html.

    After configuration the Advert service can be run locally by running:
    	$ dev_appserver.py /home/username/advert_server/
    Or it can be uploaded by running:
    	$ appcfg.py update /home/username/advert_server/
    where "/home/username/advert_server/" is the location of the Advert server
    source.
    
    More information on the SDK can be found at 
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/.

API
    The API of the Advert Server can be found in the Programmer's Manual, 
    present in ./doc/progman.tex.
